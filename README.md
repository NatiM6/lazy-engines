A small create add-on that makes steam engines very configurable.

Adds config options for heat levels from passive sources and burners, the required size and water supply of the engine and the rotation and power it supplies.

# Versions
Fabric version might be a little bit behind since it is being ported separately.
We are planning to switch to a multiloader template, so updates will be for all versions.
